        <p class="The_Most_Text_ever">
            What exactly does "Mission Vigilant" do, 
            I am glad you have asked yourself this important question.
            Now sit back and let me help explain to you what we do as a 
            organization, <br> Firstly we help raise money with organizations
            like a 5k walk/run, raffle tickets, and much more. With the money we get 
            we pour it into helping people who have severed our country and first
            responders we pay for their therapy.

        <p class="The_Most_Text_ever">
            Now who all do we help with this organization, well we help 
        veterans who suffer from the mental battle they have to suffer through 
        everyday with what they saw. We also help first responders such as cops,
        firefighters, military, and paramedics.

            Hello, My name is Conner Cleland and in this section I would like you 
            to understand from the point of view of a greiving family that just went 
            through a tragity that is losing a love one from suicide.
            Now I do understand that some if not most are able to feel where 
            this story will begin but some won't so I was 14 and had the unfortionut oppertunity to wake up with officers in my living room telling me my brother died from suicide. That week went by like any other but after that week it really started hurting because the pain of the lose of my brother really hit me. So with this Charity I hope to stop someone next to feel like that, please donate to us so we can help the next person who is on the edge.

        </p>
